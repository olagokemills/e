# Arton tech angular dev test

Using the Free open weather map api (http://openweathermap.org/forecast5 api key has been included inside weather.service.ts)

  * Build an application that allows you to search the weather forecast for a city. 
  * Every time a new city is searched - Add to a table of cities displaying the next 24 hours weather forecast.
  * Ensure you use the ngrx state management middleware
  * You can build this application within 96 hours from when you recieve this link

We have provided a skeleton application  generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.
## Expectations
  * Upgrade the application to the latest version as expected
  * Ensure some refactoring is done to make the application compatible with version upgraded to
  * Complete the components(search, results and the weather container)
  * Complete the Weather.service.ts, using the API provided by the openweathermap for a given city
  * Complete the unit test files (*.spec.ts). (You are allowed to change the unit test framework to Jest)
  * Interfaces have been provided in model/weather.ts. Please use these interfaces. (You are allowed to add your own interfaces)
  * An example layout table is provided inside the results component.Please use this as template. (The template is basic, I expect some creativity)
  * We expect the application to compile and all the tests to pass.
  * We expect that you would refactor most of the existing basic code and apply your own design thoughts and patterns
  * You are free to add extended features that show your logical thinking process
  * Please upload your code to GITHUB and once you are done send us the link.
